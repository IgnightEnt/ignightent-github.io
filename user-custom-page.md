>" To light up the night ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ™  Sparking connections, igniting our inner fire, and spreading the light of consciousness - The most lit Human experience. "

__Then__

Mike Ignight is a drummer by nature.  A DJ by trade.  And a producer for fun.  He stated playing piano and percussion at the age of 8, because he thought it was cool to make noise.  Fast forward through the symphonic band, orchestra, rock, punk, ska, and metal band performances in prep-school, highschool and college...  Mike caught the electronic music bug in the 90s, but it was his first massive rave experience (seeing Tiesto perform at Ultra Miami 2010) that really sparked his fire; Mike was going to swap his sticks for decks, he was going to produce electronic music and be a DJ.

__Now__

Ignight has been blessed to open for Autograf, Curbi, N2N, Yolanda Be Cool, SkiiTour, take a DJ lesson with A-Trak, and has shared the stage with Skrillex, Zeds Dead, Diplo, Flosstradamus, < href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BbP1mW5hABx/" target="_blank">[Destructo, Louis the Child, Anna Lunoe, Wax Motif, Kill the Noise, Tchami]</a>, and more.  You likely haven't heard of Ignight yet because he enjoys his privacy...  That's about to change.

Mike has set his sights on lighting people up by championing the charge for a healthier nightlife.  He co-founded of Sundown Music Festival, Sercret Dance Addiction, and Ignight Entertainment to invest in the mental & physical health of his audience.  Ignight believes that we go to events to connect to ourselves, to eachother, and to lose ourselves in the music.

Ignight's music reaches deep into the ancient wisdom & spiritualities of the soul, igniting a flame that spreads, illuminating a light that lasts.
Ignight spans industries, genres, and formats; forging immersive audio for original productions, recording the most bizarre foley sounds, designing effects for videogames, and composing themes for cinema, all for one simple purpose: to light people up.

Stay lit.
