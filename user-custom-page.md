To Ignight is to light up the night 🔥🌙  Sparking connections, igniting our inner fire, and spreading the light of consciousness is the most lit thing we can experience.

Ignight lives a radical, rebellious lifestyle, shining a beacon for a brighter high than intoxicants could ever provide.  Ignight's music reaches deep into the ancient wisdom & spiritualities of the soul, igniting a flame that spreads, illuminating a light that lasts.

Ignight once convinced Skrillex that he was Tiesto, then asked him to take a selfie 👌😐  He has opened for Autograf, Curbi, N2N, Yolanda Be Cool, SkiiTour, and is the co-founder of Sundown Music Festival, Sercret Dance Addiction, and Ignight Entertainment.  His art spans industries, genres, and formats; forging immersive audio for original productions, recording the most bizarre foley sounds, designing effects for videogames, and composing themes for cinema.
